        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <p>UNITS: US</p>
        <p>1 (8 ounce) package macaroni</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1 cup milk</p>
        <p>1 cup cream</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>fresh ground black pepper, to taste</p>
        <p>2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded (good quality)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup buttered breadcrumbs</p>
    </div>

    <div class="directions">
        <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400Â°F.</p>
        <p>Cook and drain macaroni according to package directions; set aside.</p>
        <p>In a large saucepan, melt butter.</p>
        <p>Add flour mixed with salt and pepper, using a whisk to stir until well blended.</p>
        <p>Pour milk and cream in gradually; stirring constantly.</p>
        <p>Bring to boiling point and boil for 2 minutes (stirring constantly).</p>
        <p>Reduce heat and cook for 10 minutes (stirring constantly).</p>
        <p>Add shredded cheddar little by little and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese melts.</p>
        <p>Turn off the flame.</p>
        <p>Add macaroni to the saucepan and toss to coat with the cheese sauce.</p>
        <p>Transfer macaroni to a buttered baking dish.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle with breadcrumbs.</p>
        <p>Bake for 20 minutes until the top is golden brown.</p>
        <p>(You can also freeze this recipe in zip-lock bags for later use. Once you have mixed the macaroni along with the cheese sauce, allow it to cool to room temperature before adding it to your freezer. I generally pull it out the night before and allow the macaroni and cheese to reach room temperature. Then, add it to a buttered baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top and bubbling.)</p>
