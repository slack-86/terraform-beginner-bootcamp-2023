        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <p>UNITS: US</p>
        <p>1 (8 ounce) package macaroni</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1 cup milk</p>
        <p>1 cup cream</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>fresh ground black pepper, to taste</p>
        <p>2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded good quality</p>
        <p>1/2 cup breadcrumbs, buttered</p>

        <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400Â°F.</p>
        <p>Cook and drain macaroni according to package directions; set aside.</p>
        <p>In a large saucepan melt butter.</p>
        <p>Add flour mixed with salt and pepper, using a whisk to stir until well blended.</p>
        <p>Pour milk and cream in gradually; stirring constantly.</p>
        <p>Bring to boiling point and boil 2 minutes (stirring constantly).</p>
        <p>Reduce heat and cook (stirring constantly) 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add shredded cheddar little by little and simmer an additional 5 minutes, or until cheese melts.</p>
        <p>Turn off flame.</p>
        <p>Add macaroni to the saucepan and toss to coat with the cheese sauce.</p>
        <p>Transfer macaroni to a buttered baking dish.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle with breadcrumbs.</p>
        <p>Bake 20 minutes until the top is golden brown.</p>
        <p>(You can also freeze this recipe in zip-lock bags for later use - once you have mixed the macaroni along with the cheese sauce allow to cool to room temperature before adding to your freezer - I generally pull it out the night before and allow macaroni and cheese to reach room temperature; I then add the macaroni and cheese to a buttered baking dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and then bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top and bubbling.</p>
